# overview

An xdotool example script, which launches youtube live in chromium browser.

The script:
 - launches browser
 - navigates to youtube.com
 - moves mouse cursor to upload button
 - clicks the upload button

# Concept of proof

This might not work on your machine directly. This is concept of proof.

This works:
 - on Linux Mint cinamon environment with chromium browser
 - on Full HD resolution

In order to use it on your machine you would have to tweak pixel values & sleep values.

# prerequisites

 - xdotool
 - chromium-browser

# The idea

In order to stream live on YouTube on mobile you have to have 1000 subscribers in your account.

It would be nice to have a setup:
 - raspberry pi
 - small portable camera with sound

... and to be able to stream
